I originally thought this book would be like the standard romance novels I’ve read: girl meets boy, boy helps girl, boy falls in love girl, boy and girl are together. While that structure that I’ve witnessed over the years still holds quite true in this context, I was wonderfully surprised by the plot lines in the book that not only made the book more nuanced but made it a life altering read. 

The book follows Charlotte Hodges, a fresh high school graduate who loves to write. When she finds that she’s won a scholarship to study with one of the modern literary greats Luca Bruni on his private island in Venice, she’s overjoyed. Her need to write runs in her blood: her ancestor Isabela di Angelo wrote poetry and wrote The Verses, a collection of poetry that has been with her family for 500 years. However, all that is known about her is that she was the lover of the famed poet of the time Antonio Tasso. Charlotte hopes that she can figure out more about her ancestor and figure out if is, indeed, the author of a very famous poem.

What starts as an enlightening, eye-opening experience turns into something darker and murkier than Charlotte ever expected. Not only does the island La Calamita where they are stationed have a dark, looming past, Luca Bruni is not all that he seems, and many girls leave, including Charlotte, who grows uncomfortable with his preying. Charlotte works with Dante, a fellow book lover, and his historian professor to uncover more of Isabella di Angelo, whose story is just beginning even though it happened hundreds of years ago.

This book touches on the “separating art from the artist” issue. While you may not condone someone’s action, can’t you still support their content without supporting the person? Additionally, Caletti uses clever parallels to signify the universal struggle of women through the ages struggling to get their voices heard amidst an oppressive patriarchy.

It not only inspires women to be brave and express themselves, but shows the importance of making sure your voice is heard. That being said, the beginning did seem to drag a little bit. It was a lot of setup before the program started detailing her life before it was irrevocably changed. While I do feel it was necessary, it took awhile for me to get through. It could give readers the wrong impression that the whole book is that way on when it’s only a small portion of the book and might deter them from reading this book which discusses some important topics. 

If you’re looking for a book from the literary fiction canon suitable for teens and young adults with all the elements consistent with YA, definitely check out One Great Lie by Deb Caletti. You won’t regret it.
