Reese Camden is spending her summer before her freshman year of college working at Friends of Flavor as a marketing intern, a food channel that has different chefs (i.e. Friends) leading different cooking shows. Reese has been a big fan of FoF since her freshman year of high school, and is gunning for the fall internship available for one person at the end of the summer. Enter Benny: charming, confident, and a culinary aficionado, he’s the culinary intern at FoF who also wants the coveted fall internship. Reese plans to never cross paths with him and his flirtatious tendencies after they meet but is mightily disappointed when they are paired up for an impromptu show, where the two interns work together to create a dish. The show ends up being a huge success, and just like that Benny and Reese are thrown into the limelight, together, much to Reese’s dismay. It seems that avoiding her flamboyant, albeit charming co-star and not catching feelings may be a lot harder than Reese anticipated…

I was given this book by one of my close friends, who took the time to annotate the book with her thoughts and feelings. She’s not a romance reader by any stretch of the imagination, so I was flattered that she read the book anyway since she thought I would enjoy it. That being said, I tried my best to separate her thoughts from my own, though they coincided a bit. 

I thought this was a cute story with a lot of potential, but it fell flat for me in a few places. When I saw that there were culinary/baking aspects to the story, I was excited to read about all of the delicious food they made and the imagery that comes with it. To my dismay, I found that those tasty, mouthwatering descriptions of the dishes that they created were reduced to short paragraphs, even when the cooking scenes were pages long. While I understand that this is a romance book first and foremost, I would’ve liked more subplot as it would’ve added more depth to the story overall. 

Additionally, I was surprised to see the themes of feminism reiterated throughout the novel. As a young woman working in a male dominated industry putting herself online, Reese is faced with trolls and sexist male coworkers who don’t seem to take her or her ideas seriously. This is a major tenet of the book since it refers to a negative experience with a guy she dated years ago. This was bittersweet for me: on one hand, I’m glad that the book mentioned discussed such pertinent issues of today’s society, but I felt as if the trauma that Reese faced years ago was so that she could bond and become closer to Benny. This is problematic for a variety of reasons, one of which is that it is unhealthy for a relationship to be based solely off of trauma and hurt from the past. 

Despite this, I kept reading and I thought it was…kind of boring. The second half of the book was terribly predictable, with Reese and Benny having a falling out and then making up since they realized that they were both wrong and that they really, really missed each other (can you hear the sarcasm in my voice?). Normally, I love stories like this, but this was so painfully basic it was kind of a struggle to get through the book.

Don’t waste your time on this book. There are a bunch of really cute, really scrumptious culinary books out there that are worth your while.
