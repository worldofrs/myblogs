“Me diré que tu andas y te diré quien eres.”

This directly translates to “Tell me who you hang out with and I’ll tell you who you are.”

Already, I was intrigued and decided to keep on reading, which ended up being one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. 

I picked up this book after going through a bit of a reading slump, when I was willing to read just about anything. It’s different from what I normally read: where romance isn’t the main plot of the story and from an author, a style of writing that I wasn’t familiar with. 

Despite that, this book surpassed all my abysmal expectations to land itself as one of my favorite books real quick.

The main character Izzy Crawford lives in a trailer park with her hardworking Puerto Rican mother and younger brother Jack. They live paycheck to paycheck and have moved a lot since her marine father died in Iraq six years ago. Izzy goes to an all-girl’s Catholic school, where she hides her scholarship status and avoids all mention of where she lives or her family’s finances.  

All Izzy craves is stability and permanence, and her family is about to get that when her family is accepted in the Habitat for Humanity program, where they will finally get their own house. However, all good things come at a cost. To get this house, her family needs 300 “sweat equity” hours, time put in where they or their family members put in hours to build the house.

But with only her and her mom able to put in the time, it’s going to take a while to get those hours. Things become even trickier when she starts talking to Sam Shakelton, a really beautiful boy (her words, not mine) whose sister goes to her school. He also happens to be her friend/neighbor-across-the-street Roz, who is obsessed with him. 

At first, nothing seems to be possible between them; Sam has a girlfriend. But then he breaks up with her, and the possibility of something between Izzy and Sam seems plausible. They decide to date, but Izzy is still adamant on keeping her home situation a secret. 

She acts very suspicious, and Sam can see it. Izzy is barely keeping her head above water when her family has to go attend a Habitat for Humanity dinner, where they will meet all the benefactors and donors, among whom will be Sam’s parents. The prospect is humiliating for Izzy, so she decides to pay her cousin Mark a visit in North Carolina, who she hasn’t seen in years. There, she learns that her dad’s mom never accepted her mom or her, and that’s why they never went back. However, she ends up reconnecting with Mark, and he ends up coming back to West Virginia with her to help her and her mom with sweat equity hours.

Her mom is upset that she left abruptly, but is grateful for the help. Izzy also confronts Sam, who now knows about her true home life and is disappointed that she felt like she couldn’t tell him about it. Izzy realizes that people knowing may not be so bad, and actually allows her to be more free and content with herself. Soon, her a capella friends know and they’re helping with sweat equity hours. They build a team and a community, and Izzy learns that the only way to establish permanence and roots is to be your true self with those closest to you.

This story was heartwarming in every sense of the word. Not only was it entertaining, with you rooting for Izzy and Sam, it also teaches life lessons that some people never learn, and encourages others that showing the parts you are ashamed of does not make you weak but strong.
