Fake It Till You Break It is a light-hearted teen romance by Jenn P. Nguyen. The two main characters, Mia Le and Jake Adler, are neighbors and their moms are best friends. They’re always being dragged on dim sum brunch dates, joined vacations and even shared dentist trips and their moms are dying for them to become a couple; seriously, they even made the ship name Jakia for them. But, much to their moms’ dismay, Mia and Jake can’t stand each other.

So they come up with an ingenious plan: they’re going to fake date each other to appease their overly involved mothers, and then break up so they won’t have to see each other ever again. 

The hardest part is getting their mother’s to believe the charade, but it will be well worth it. Mia has a big crush on Ben in her theater group and Jake does not want to go on a cruise trip where his brother works, especially since he abandoned him and his mom two years ago.

But maybe they don’t actually hate each other, as they soon find out…

I really enjoyed the book; it’s a perfect summer beach read when you don't think too much and enjoy some fun romance that seems too good to be true. While some parts of this book were unbelievable and cringe-inducing moments, I did find myself swooning in the build up of their relationship and squealing when they inevitably realized that they liked each other all along. 

However, the fact that their mothers were as involved in their relationship and were rooting for them with such vehemence seems a little…unrealistic. They were CONSTANTLY talking about how good the other seemed to their child, all their good qualities and such. I just found it a little hard to believe, but it was an endearing plot point that, I must admit, added another layer of complexity to their “hatred” of each other.

This book is really short and upbeat; I finished in less than a day. While it may be one-sided and predictable, it’s the kind of book that warms you up from the inside.
