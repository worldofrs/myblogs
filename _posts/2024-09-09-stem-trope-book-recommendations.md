Are you in the mood for a story where the girl is a certified girl-boss with some romance on the side? Here are some of my personal favorites where the female protagonist is a steminist that will be sure to give you butterflies.

1. My Mechanical Romance by Alexene Farol Follmuth

The story revolves around Bel Maier, a senior in high school who never had a plan but somehow ended up at the prestigious Essex Academy. After she completes a physics assignment hastily, Bel is recommended by her teacher to join the robotics team, where she meets Teo Luna, soccer star, son of tech mogul Mateo Luna, and academic powerhouse who's looking for a final member to round out his team. Even while inexperienced, Bel makes the team, but it isn’t without backlash. None of the guys (even the one girl) are showing her any respect and she and Teo keep butting heads. However, as they’re both forced to spend time as Teo shows her the ropes and they work to build their robot, unsurprisingly, feelings emerge. But will their personality differences keep them apart?


2. The Code for Love and Heartbreak by Jillian Cantor

An adaptation of Emma by Jane Austen, protagonist Emma Woodhouse is sure to capture your hearts. Emma can count on numbers; people…not so much, which is why as co-president of the coding club, she decides to pitch the idea of creating an app that mathematically matches people based on compatibility metrics. Her co-president, George, is not a fan, but Emma decides to create a prototype of the app to sway him. 

3. Love Decoded by Jennifer Yen

Love Decoded follows Gigi Wong, the sister of James Wong from Yen’s debut? novel A Taste for Love (if you know, you know). Gigi wants to stand out, but that’s hard when everyone in her school is perfect. She decides to create Quizlr, an app that opens up a chat room between two people deemed most compatible in an effort to help the new girl make friends and to submit to an app contest. It seems like a great idea…yet something goes awry, and Gigi is forced to confront her feelings about life, compatibility, and love.

4. Not Here to Be Liked by Michelle Quach

Eliza Quan wants to be the Editor-in-Chief of her school newspaper, The Bugle. However, she’s given some competition when Len DiMartile decides to run against her. When he ends up getting the position instead, Eliza writes an essay that ends up going viral. She’s now a controversial figure — some believe that she’s using misogyny as an excuse for her failure to capture the position, while other believe she is a feminist queen. Whether she wanted to or not, Eliza starts a feminist movement in her school, and is reluctant to be civil to Len. However, the more time she spends with Len, the more she starts falling for him… While this one book doesn’t have a clear girls-in-stem trope, I believe Eliza’s spunk and determination earn her a spot on this list as an honoree steminist (because she totally would be if she weren’t so busy on her school newspaper) anyway.

5. The Quantum Weirdness of the Almost Kiss by Amy Noelle Parks

Caleb and Evie are best friends, and as most of these stories go, Caleb has had a crush on Evie for a long time. Now, he knows that Evie isn’t ready for romance — she’s busy with math and her anxiety — but secretly thought that when she was ready, it would be with him, the best friend. But Evie is feeling braver, and that means she’s ready to give love a go…but with the new cute gifted math student. Caleb is horrified and realizes that he’s never going to win her heart when there’s a mysterious stranger in the equation, so he decides to go online and talk to her via anonymity, an attempt to capture her heart. But as time goes on, Evie is just more confused because she doesn't know who she likes more: Caleb, or the anonymous stranger online…
