Audrey St. Vrain has grown up to be a person she never chose to be. Years before she was born, her mother, Camilla St. Vrain, published the revolutionary self-help book The Someday Daughter, encouraging women to be kind themselves as they would to their own hypothetical daughters. Most would assume that Audrey and Camilla have the perfect mother-daughter relationship, but it is far from it – she feels like a pawn in her mom’s career plan rather than her daughter, being sent to boarding school in the sixth grade and all. Before she heads off to college, she is determined to create her own identity, and that starts by going to the prestigious medical program at UPenn with her boyfriend Ethan before she goes off in the fall to study at John Hopkins. However, when Camilla asks her to go on a promotional tour for the book’s 25th anniversary, nothing this summer is going the way Audrey planned. She’s stuck with her mother for the summer – maybe now the chance she and Audrey learn to fit into each other’s lives, just as they are.

I’ve been kind of busy lately, and my life’s felt like a blur, so this book was a nice change of pace reminding me to really appreciate my family and those around me. Audrey’s mom is famous, but unlike most, her mom’s success basically coincides with her existence. Imagine your legacy, your conception being anticipated by not just your parents and those close, but the whole entire world? Honestly, it’s no surprise that their relationship is strained, at least on Audrey’s end. It’s kind of a recipe for disaster – unmet expectations + uncontrollable circumstances? Forget about it. I would resent my mom if she sent me off to boarding school and used me to promote her business. It’s why I was with Audrey from the get go, dreading every interaction with her mom alongside her. I wanted to stomp away like a petulant teenager. However, slowly but surely, they’re relationship starts to grow stronger, and watching (or reading, in this case) it happen is a very beautiful thing. There are secrets between them (not to spoil anything) and watching them learn how to be around each other is sometimes painful but very heartwarming. I hated Camilla A LOT less by the time I reached the end of the book, maybe even liked her.

Audrey is very relatable, in my opinion, especially as someone who also likes to control all the unknowns and be sure about everything, down to the tee. I like her a lot, and loved watching her fall in love with Silas, one of three interns from American University, her mom’s alma mater of course, on tour for the summer helping with filming and videography. It was genuine, heartfelt, unforced, one of the better slow-burns I’ve read, which is saying something considering the book is only 319 pages. You just can’t help but root for two such likable characters, especially his dug Puddles. I’m not a dog person (don’t come for me), but even I found her absolutely adorable through the fibers of the page. Audrey won’t come to terms for her feelings for Silas, but it’s obviously very clear that she has them…even though he’s not her type, she can’t help but feel on edge and in-her-feels when around him. 

Overall, I enjoyed this book. It was a much needed reminder that not everything is as serious as it seems and that you WILL be okay, even though sometimes, it doesn’t feel like it. And if there’s an absolutely, positively, adorable dog? Well then what are you waiting for?!
