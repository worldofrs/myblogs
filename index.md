  ## Book Out Below!
  ### A Jekyll boilerplate theme designed to be a starting point for any Jekyll website
  This is a blog dedicated to giving true thoughts and opinions on all the books I read. As a voracious reader, I come across a lot of books -- some I love and some I...don't. My mission is to give you food for thought so you can spend less time finding books and more time reading books you actually enjoy.
